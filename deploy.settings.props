        The following ItemGroup defines which steps are taken during the deploy process. The order of the items in the item group
        determines in which order the deploy steps are executed.

        Each deploy step can define the following items:
        - Properties                                     - The semi-colon separated set of properties that should be passed to the script.
                                                           Properties are written as 'key=value'.
        - Groups                                         - All the groups that a given step belongs to. The user can elect to only run deploy steps for a given group.
        - PreSteps                                       - A semi-colon separated list of all additional scripts and their targets that should be executed before
                                                           the selected deploy step.

        Additionally all the standard properties as seen below and the properties for the given deploy step are passed in.

        The following ItemGroup defines which steps are taken during the deploy process. The order of the items in the item group
        determines in which order the deploy steps are executed.

        The following deploy steps are by default provided through the given properties:
        $(DeployStepsBuildTargetsAssembly) - Builds Visual Studio projects that contain MsBuild Tasks. Separate from building the standard Visual Studio
                                             solutions so that it is possible to build MsBuild tasks that will be used in the build process.
        $(DeployStepsGenerateTargetsFile)  - Generates a targets file for use with an MsBuild tasks assembly.
        $(DeployStepsPrepareRestoreNuGet)  - Restores the NuGet packages as specified in the '$(DirWorkspace)\packages.config' file. Additionally
                                             also restores the NuGet packages as specified in the nBuildKit specific 'packages.config' files.
        $(DeployStepsPrepareVcsBranch)     - When building from a GIT repository on Jenkins ensures that the current checkout has the same branch
                                             name as the remote tracking branch.
        $(DeployStepsPrepareGetVersion)    - Gathers version information and stores it in a temporary file for use by the rest of the deploy process.
                                             Currently supported methods of gathering version information are using (in order):
                                             - The version defined by a custom MsBuild task which is defined in a file of which the path is stored
                                               in the 'VersionScriptPath' property. The task should output:
                                                 - VersionMajor
                                                 - VersionMinor
                                                 - VersionPatch
                                                 - VersionBuild
                                                 - VersionPreRelease
                                                 - VersionSemantic
                                                 - VersionSemanticFull
                                                 - VersionSemanticNuget
                                             - The version stored in an 'version.xml' file which contains an MsBuild property group with
                                               the properties:
                                                 - BuildNumber
                                                 - VersionMajor
                                                 - VersionMinor
                                                 - VersionPatch
                                                 - VersionBuild
                                                 - VersionPreRelease
                                             - The GitVersion tool (https://github.com/ParticularLabs/GitVersion)
                                             - The GitHubFlowVersion tool (https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/GitHubFlowVersion)
        $(DeployStepsPrepareTagVcs)        - Tags the current commit with the version number. Currently supported version control systems are TFS and GIT.
        $(DeployStepsPrepareGetIssueIds)   - Gets the issue IDs from the commits on the current branch and stores them in a temp file for later use.
        $(DeployStepsPrepareCopyNuGet)     - Copies one or more files from a NuGet package.
        $(DeployStepsPrepareCopyFiles)     - Copies one or more files from the file system.
        $(DeployStepsPushToTags)           - Pushes the tags to a remote git repository
        $(DeployStepsPushToNuget)          - Pushes one or more artifacts to a NuGet feed
        $(DeployStepsPushToDirectory)      - Pushes one or more artifacts to a directory
        $(DeployStepsPushToSymbolServer)   - Pushes one or more NuGet symbol packages to a local symbol server on a UNC path
        $(DeployStepsPushToGitHubRelease)  - Pushes zero or more files to a GitHub release
        $(DeployStepsPushToGitBranch)      - Pushes zero or more files to a Git branch. Any files that currently exist on that branch are removed
                                             and replaced by the specified files.
        $(DeployStepsPushToGitRepository)  - Pushes an archived local workspace to a Git repository.

        Additional deploy steps can be defined by providing the path to the MsBuild script that should be executed
        for that step, e.g. adding a deploy step that points to the 'c:\stuff\MyCoolScript.msbuild' will execute
        that script.

        Any properties defined by the 'Properties' section are pushed up.
